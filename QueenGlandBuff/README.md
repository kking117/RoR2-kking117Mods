## QueenGlandBuff

The goal of this mod is to buff Beetle Guards spawned by the Queen's Gland so they provide more than just emotional support.

**Skill Changes**

The biggest issue with Beetle Guards is their inability to fight an aerial enemy, to counter this its attacks now launch projectiles.
These extra projectiles also make Beetle Guards deal a lot of extra damage so their damage has been reduced to compensate.

For its Slam skill it fires out 3 projectiles evenly upwards. This is mostly for crowds and flying enemies that are just out of range.

Its Sunder skill now fires 3 projectiles in the direction the Guard is aiming. This allows them to hit flying enemies.

**AI Changes**

The AI now prefers to use Sunder over Slam, this is so it doesn't get locked into using Slam against flying enemies that are slightly out of reach.

**Item/Stacking Changes**

Players can only have 1 Beetle Guard each, further stacks increase their health and damage.
The 30 seconds respawn timer now actually works.
Beetle Guards spawn with an elite affix for some extra spice.

**Extra Skills**

The mod also adds a Special skill called "Valor". This skill gives 100 armor for 10 seconds and also draws the attention of common enemies.
