**1.25.1**

```
- Titanic Knurl Rework B:
- Changed "Laser Base Damage" default configuration. (0.5 -> 0.625)
- Changed "Base Duration" default configuration. (3.0 -> 4.0)
^ Laser itself felt too short by base and weak (like 1/3 of Laser of the Father's dps weak).
- Added some random spread to the extra shots.
- Laser begins a bit sooner when activated.
- Laser will fire from the user's head, if one cannot be found it will revert to their AimRay instead.

^ A more active alternative to the first rework that's based on the Stone Titan's laser ability.

- Newly Hatched Zoea Rework:

```

**1.23.5**

<details><summary>Notes</summary>Small update to fix some problems I noticed while playing, haven't played RoR2 in a while.</details>

```
- Partially updated for v1.3.5.

- Unstable Transmitter Rework:

- Sonorous Whispers Rework:
- Now spawns on the Monster Team instead of Neutral as it caused many problems.

```

**1.23.4**

```
- Lost Seer's Lenses:
- Fixed chance not being affected by luck.
```

**1.23.3**

```
- Sonorous Whispers Rework:
- Actually fixed monster selection, whoops.
```

**1.23.2**

```
- Sonorous Whispers Rework:
- Added "Reward Limit" configuration, limits the amount of item rewards the monster can drop. Also caps other stacking effects when reaching this limit. (Default: 200)
- Added "Base Gold" and "Stack Gold" configurations, makes the monster give scaling gold upon defeat, I mean it is made of gold. (Default: 200, 100)
- Fixed "Base Rewards" and "Stack Rewards" configurations having no affect on item reward amounts.
- Now uses the Run's RNG when selecting the monster to spawn.

- Artifact of Spite:
- Changes moved to a new mod.

- Added a rework to Sonorous Whispers.

- Leeching Seed Rework:
- Healing from the Leech debuff is now scaled from the attacker's expected damage stat at level rather than their damage stat.
^ Just means having damage stat increases from items will actually increase the healing, for example Shaped Glass will now increase the healing previously it did not.

- Lepton Daisy:
- Removed the hyperbolic stacking calculations and made it linear.
^ Felt needlessly complicated, plus it's okay for some items to reach hard limits.
- Changed "Stack Healing" default configuration. (10 -> 5)

- Unstable Transmitter Rework:
- Added configuration "Respawn Minion", setting it to false makes the Strike Drone not respawn until the user respawns, like how Spare Drone Parts and Col. Droneman work. (Default: False)

```

**1.22.5**

- Changed "Stack Duration" default configuration. (7 -> 4)

- Description now mentions that it cleanses damage over time.

- Symbiotic Scorpion Rework:
- AI Blacklisted for real this time.
```

**1.22.4**

<details><summary>Notes</summary>Death Mark Rework has been changed completely and the fix to expired pings has been moved to a seperate mod. Most changes made are balancing related with a focus on being more consistent with the game, doing all this as the idea of the mod being complete is within sight, but still a while away.</details>

```
- Knockback Fin:
- Fixed certain flying enemies not going on cooldown once they have stable velocity, such as Flying Pests and Alloy Vultures.
- Made velocity based damage more consistent and the damage cap much more realistic to achieve.

- Death Mark Rework:
- Scrapped since the ping system can be quite frustrating at times.
- Changed to be closer to how Death Mark works but less binary and can be tweaked to work better with modded setups.
- Is now classed as a buff instead of a rework.

- Ignition Tank Rework:
- Added a configuration to make the proc requirement chance based like it was originally. (Default: 0, Originally: 10)

- Leeching Seed Rework:
- Added a configuration to make the healing from DoTs scale with the tick rate of said DoT. (It was doing this already by default)
- Changed "Base DoT Healing" default configuration. (4 -> 1)
- Changed "Stack DoT Healing" default configuration. (4 -> 1)
^ A tick rate of 4 is used as the baseline for DoT scaling so the healing amount is unchanged with these values.
- Changed "Leech Base Damage" default configuration. (0.5 -> 2.5) (Unchanged technically)
- Replaced "Leech Stack Duration" with "Leech Stack Damage" configuration.
^ This is done to be consistent with how other items increase their DoT damage.
- Healing from the Leech debuff is now scaled from the attacker's damage stat rather than with time.
- Changed "Leech Life Steal" default configuration. (0.1 -> 1)
- Removed "Leech Minimum Life Steal", now always in effect at a value of 1.

- Unstable Transmitter Rework:
- Changed "Cap Cooldown" default configuration. (2 -> 1) (I thought this would be annoying to hear constantly but it's not.)
- Changed "Base Radius" default configuration. (15 -> 16)

- Symbiotic Scorpion Rework:
- Changed "Slayer DoT Base Damage" default configuration. (1 -> 2)
^ Originally at 1 for balance reasons, but decided to set it to 2 so it's consistent with actual Slayer damage.
- Changed "Venom Base Damage" default configuration. (8 -> 6)
- Changed "Venom Stack Damage" default configuration. (8 -> 6)
- Removed Monster specific interaction, is now AI Blacklisted by default.

- Titanic Knurl Rework:
- Changed "Stack Cooldown" default configuration. (0.15 -> 0.25)
```

- Item description now states that the health amount increases with level to avoid confusion.

- Knockback Fin:
- Renamed "Distance Damage" configuration to "Velocity Damage" to properly reflect what it does.

- This means "Credit Fall Damage" will work even while Impact damage is disabled.
- Will no longer proc when hitting yourself.

- Topaz Brooch:
- Changed "Base Flat Barrier" default configuration. (15 -> 8)
- Changed "Stack Flat Barrier" default configuration. (15 -> 0)
- Changed "Base Percent Barrier" default configuration. (0.005 -> 0.02)
- Changed "Stack Percent Barrier" default configuration. (0.005 -> 0.02)

- Changed "Proc Healing" and "Base Healing" default configurations. (0.75 -> 1)
```

- Unstable Transmitter Rework:
- Allies now get 1s of invincibility upon teleporting.
- Added configurations "Teleport Radius" and "Telefrag Radius" to control the range of ally teleports.

- Added configuration "Proc Bands", controls if the blast can proc bands or not.
```

**1.22.0**

```
- Antler Shield Rework:
- Properly marked as a rework in the config.

- Knockback Fin:
- Damage now scales from the target's velocity so it makes more sense with higher stacks against airborne targets.

- Added a rework for Unstable Transmitter.

**1.21.1**

```
- Knockback Fin:
- Added "Flying Force Mult" configuration, a knockback multiplier against flying enemies.
- Removed "Small Force Mult", "Medium Force Mult" and "Large Force Mult" configurations as I misunderstood how the original effect was coded.

```
- Split up configs into more categories, "General", "Items" and "Artifacts".
- All item changes default to disabled now instead of only reworks.

**1.18.0**

<details><summary>Notes</summary>I greatly suggest checking the configs in regards to the Ignition Tank rework, there's a few umentioned options that might be worth changing. Also no full bug testing has been done in regards to the recent RoR2 Update, wanted to churn this out before RoRR.</details>

```
- Leeching Seed Rework:
- The Healing from DoTs is now scaled by the DoT's tick rate, faster ticks heal less and slower ticks heal more. (For context most DoTs tick 4 times a second so they will give 1/4th of the intended amount.)

- Added "Stack DoT Healing" configuration, controls how much healing each DoT tick gives for each additional stack. Default Value: (4)

- Damage over time ticks from the Leech debuff no longer triggers its life steal effect, so it doesn't double dip with Leeching Seed.
- Healing from the Leech debuff and Leeching Seed are now rolled into a singular instance of healing, for visual clarity and because they're both related to the same item.
