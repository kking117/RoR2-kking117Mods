## Overview

Newly Hatched Zoea is difficult to obtain and suffers from being incredibly underwhelming compared to when you get it and what it takes.
The goal of this mod is to make the item more exciting and interesting to match its scarcity.
There's a choice for a buff which improves the item but keeps it close to the original function, and there's a rework for a more radical change.

Configs are provided to tweak most of the changes.

## Buff

```
- Only corrupts Queen's Glands.
- Cannot be inherited. (Engineer turrets, etc)
- Summons every 30 seconds instead of 60 (-50% per stack) seconds.
- Can have up to 3 allies at once, instead of 1 (+1 per stack) allies.
- Summoned creature is now determined by a fixed list, instead of a random chance with Void Devastators being the rarest.
- Summons can teleport back to their owner if they're too far away.
- Summoned Void Reavers will sprint towards their target and detonate if their health is low.
- Stacking increases the damage and health of the summons, instead of the reducing the summon cooldown and raising the total summons.
```

This buff aims to improve the base strength of the Newly Hatched Zoea.
One way it does this is by taking some of the rng away from what Void creature is summoned, this smooths out the average strength of the item.
Stacking improves the quality of the summons rather than the quantity, this is to avoid hitting the ally cap.
Void Reavers were given a suicide attack to make them more useful as they're incredibly weak compared to the Jailer and Devastator.

## Rework

```
- Corrupts "boss" items. (By default all vanilla yellow items that drop from bosses.)
- Cannot be inherited. (Engineer turrets, etc)
- Summons a single Void Devastator, instead of multiple random Void creatures.
- The Void Devastator can teleport to its owner if it's too far away.
- Stacking increases the Void Devastator's damage instead of the total summon count.
- The Void Devastator inherits their owner's items.
```

This item is now about having a single powerful minion, that inherits your items.
I'm personally against allowing item summons to inherit items, but I believe this item is special enough to allow it.

## Future Possibilities

- More configurations to adjust Void Ally stats.
- More configurations for inheritance blacklist and general inheritance function.
- DLC2 and DLC3 Item Displays for Void Devastator.

## Known Issues

- The teleport's visual effects might be out of sync for clients in some situations. (I'm guessing this exists, it might not.)
- Void Devastators in the rework will drop an item if its Umbral owner is killed first, this is a "feature" that happens in vanilla with Engineer Turrets.
- Void Reavers are clearly not designed to fight anything that can avoid floor.
